## **Description**

Chartbusters is a higher or lower music song quiz game that challenges users to guess whether the next song's chart position is higher or lower than the current song. This interactive and fun game allows users to test their knowledge of music chart history. Aimed at people aged 8 and above, the game is designed to be accessible and enjoyable for a wide range of audiences. The simple yet engaging concept makes it easy for younger players to grasp while still providing a challenge for older music enthusiasts.

Have you ever had a friendly argument with a friend about whether a song made it to No1 or not? Or even in the top ten? Well then this could be the game for you.

## **How AI Was Used**

Artificial Intelligence played a significant role in the development of this project. Here are some ways AI was utilized:

- **Code Generation**

  - AI tools like GitHub Copilot were used to generate code snippets for various parts of the website. This included HTML structure and CSS styling. The AI provided context-aware suggestions that helped streamline the coding process and reduce development time.

- **Debugging**

  - AI-powered debugging tools were utilized to identify and fix issues in the code. These tools analyzed the codebase, detected potential bugs, and provided recommendations for resolving them. This ensured a smoother development process and a more robust final product.

- **Content Assistance**

  - AI tools like GitHub Copilot were used to assist in writing code and content for the website. These tools provided suggestions and auto-completions, which sped up the development process and ensured high-quality code.

- **Accessibility Improvements**
  - AI was used to analyse the website's accessibility features.

By leveraging AI, the project was able to achieve a higher level of efficiency, creativity, and accessibility.

### **Features left to Implement**



### **Technologies Used**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## **Testing**

The website was thoroughly tested before completion.

- Manual code review to find bugs
- Manual code review to check accessability requirements eg. alt text on images
- Check site with W3S HTML/CSS validator
- All links work and external links open in a new tab
- Manually test site locally. for example, rendering issues, images loading, navigation links, scale at breakpoints, check console for errors in dev tools, etc.
- Manually test hosted site
- Testing with Dev Tools Lighthouse

### **Code Validation**

All HTML and CSS code was validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service and W3C CSS Validation Service, respectively. The results are as follows:
