## **How AI Was Used**

Artificial Intelligence played a significant role in the development of this project. Here are some ways AI was utilized:

- **Code Generation**

  - AI tools like GitHub Copilot were used to generate code snippets for various parts of the website. This included HTML structure and CSS styling. The AI provided context-aware suggestions that helped streamline the coding process and reduce development time.

- **Debugging**

  - AI-powered debugging tools were utilized to identify and fix issues in the code. These tools analyzed the codebase, detected potential bugs, and provided recommendations for resolving them. This ensured a smoother development process and a more robust final product.

- **Image Generation**

  - DALL-E, an AI model developed by OpenAI, was used to generate the images for the website.

- **Content Assistance**

  - AI tools like GitHub Copilot were used to assist in writing code and content for the website. These tools provided suggestions and auto-completions, which sped up the development process and ensured high-quality code.

- **Accessibility Improvements**
  - AI was used to analyze the website's accessibility features. Tools like Lighthouse provided insights into how accessible the website is for users with disabilities and suggested improvements to enhance user experience.

By leveraging AI, the project was able to achieve a higher level of efficiency, creativity, and accessibility.
