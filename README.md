## Table of Contents

## **Description**

Chartbusters is a higher or lower music song quiz game that challenges users to guess whether the next song's chart position is higher or lower than the current song. This interactive and fun game allows users to test their knowledge of music chart history. Aimed at people aged 8 and above, the game is designed to be accessible and enjoyable for a wide range of audiences. The simple yet engaging concept makes it easy for younger players to grasp while still providing a challenge for older music enthusiasts.

Have you ever had a friendly argument with a friend about whether a song made it to No1 or not? Or even in the top ten? Well then this could be the game for you.

## **Wireframes**

Before starting the project, a couple of basic wireframes were created to visualize the final product. Both mobile and desktop wireframes were developed.

## **How AI Was Used**

Artificial Intelligence played a significant role in the development of this project. Here are some ways AI was utilised:

- **Code Generation**

  - AI tools like GitHub Copilot were used to generate code snippets for various parts of the website. This included HTML structure and CSS styling. The AI provided context-aware suggestions that helped streamline the coding process and reduce development time.

- **Debugging**

  - AI-powered debugging tools were utilised to identify and fix issues in the code. These tools analysed the codebase, detected potential bugs, and provided recommendations for resolving them. This ensured a smoother development process and a more robust final product.

- **Accessibility Improvements**
  - AI was used to analyse the website's accessibility features.

By leveraging AI, the project was able to achieve a higher level of efficiency, creativity, and accessibility.

## **Features**

### **Existing Features**

The website includes several features, which are detailed below.

**Colour Palette:**

By leveraging bright neon blue and pink colours, the quiz game creates an appealing, dynamic, and user-friendly experience that encourages engagement and enjoyment. These vibrant colours not only make the game visually attractive but also help in creating a lively and energetic atmosphere that keeps users entertained.

**Responsive Design:**

The website is responsive and works seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This ensures that users have a consistent and enjoyable experience regardless of the device they are using. The responsive design adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, providing optimal usability and accessibility.

**Game Intro and Instructions Accordion:**

The game intro features a visually appealing logo and a prominent "Play Now" button to attract users and encourage them to start the quiz. The logo represents the theme of the game, while the "Play Now" button provides a clear call-to-action, making it easy for users to begin playing. This introductory section sets the tone for the game and enhances the overall user experience by providing an engaging and inviting entry point.
An accordion helps to reduce the appearance of the instructions and the large selection of years, making the interface cleaner and more user-friendly. This feature allows users to easily access the information they need without overwhelming them with too much content at once. The accordion design enhances the overall user experience by keeping the interface organised and intuitive.

  - Allow users to customize the appearance of the game with different themes and color schemes.

### **Technologies Used**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## **Testing**

The website was thoroughly tested before completion.

- Manual code review to find bugs
- Manual code review to check accessability requirements eg. alt text on images
- Check site with W3S HTML/CSS validator
- All links work and external links open in a new tab
- Manually test site locally. for example, rendering issues, images loading, navigation links, scale at breakpoints, check console for errors in dev tools, etc.
- Manually test hosted site
- Testing with Dev Tools Lighthouse

### **Code Validation**

All HTML and CSS code was validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service and W3C CSS Validation Service, respectively. The results are as follows:
